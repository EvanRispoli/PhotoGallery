*Flexbox helps you design your webpage so that it looks good on any screen size.
In this course, you'll use Flexbox to build a responsive photo gallery webpage.*

### STEPS


1. [x]   **Step 1**
Begin with your standard HTML boilerplate. Add a DOCTYPE declaration, an html element, a head element, and a body element.

Add the lang attribute to the opening <html> tag with en set as the value.

2. [x]   **Step 2**
Within your head element, add a meta tag with the name set to viewport and the content set to width=device-width, initial-scale=1.

Also add a meta tag with the charset set to UTF-8.

3. [x]   **Step 3**
Within your head element, add a title element with the text set to Photo Gallery, and a link element to add your styles.css file to the page.

4. [ ]   **Step 4**
Add a header element within the body element and assign a class of header to it.

5. [ ]   **Step 5**
Below your .header element, create a new div element and assign it a class of gallery. This div will act as a container for the gallery images.

Inside that .gallery element, create nine img elements.

6. [ ]   **Step 6**
Next, give each img a src attribute according to its order in the document. The first img should have a src of https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-photo-gallery/1.jpg. The rest should be the same, except replace the 1 with the number the img is in the document.

7. [ ]   **Step 7**
Normalize your box model by creating a * selector and setting the box-sizing property to border-box as the value.

8. [ ]   **Step 8**
Your images are too big. Create a .gallery img selector to target them. Give them all a width of 100% and a max-width of 350px so they shrink as needed but don't get too big.

Also set the height property to 300px to keep your images a uniform size.

9. [ ]   **Step 9**
Remove the margin from your body element, set the font-family to sans-serif, and give it a background-color of #f5f6f7 as the value.

10. [ ]   **Step 10**
Align your .header text in the center. Make the text uppercase using the text-transform property with uppercase as the value.

Give it a padding of 32px on all sides. Set the background to #0a0a23 and the text to #fff as the color values.

Add a border-bottom with 4px solid #fdb347 as the value.

11. [ ]   **Step 11**
Flexbox is a one-dimensional CSS layout that can control the way items are spaced out and aligned within a container.

To use it, give an element a display property of flex. This will make the element a flex container. Any direct children of a flex container are called flex items.

Create a .gallery selector and make it a flex container.

12. [ ]   **Step 12**
Flexbox has a main and cross axis. The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, which has four possible values:

- row (default): horizontal axis with flex items from left to right
- row-reverse: horizontal axis with flex items from right to left
- column: vertical axis with flex items from top to bottom
- column-reverse: vertical axis with flex items from bottom to top

Note: The axes and directions will be different depending on the text direction. The values shown are for a left-to-right text direction.

Try the different values to see how they affect the layout.

When you are done, set an explicit flex-direction of row on the .gallery element.
